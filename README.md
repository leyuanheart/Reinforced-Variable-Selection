# Reinforced-Variable-Selection

This repository is the official implementation of the paper ["Reinforced Variable Selection"](https://doi.org/10.1080/24754269.2025.2516346) in *Statistical Theory* *and* *Related* Fields*.

## Example code

The `classification.ipynb` and `regression.ipynb` are used to demonstrate our method.

## Reproducibility

The `synthetic_data_analysis` and `real_data_analysis` contain codes of experiments in the paper. The `npg_results` contains the data run by codes above. You can run `figures.py` to reproduce the figures in the paper.
